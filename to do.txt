- Check for no available moves (done I think?)
- Fix so all variations of shapes can appear (done I think?)

Issue:
- Game tests for availableMoves before it checks for lines to remove (?), should be the other way around so cleared space is taken into account.
- Game over message appears while option is still highlighted.
