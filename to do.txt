- Check for no available moves (done I think?)
- Fix so all variations of shapes can appear (done I think?)

Issue:
- Game tests for availableMoves before it checks for lines to remove (?), should be the other way around so cleared space is taken into account.
- Game over message appears while option is still highlighted.


Game flow:

Init:-
  GetStartingOptions() // generate random three options
  drawOptions() // Draw three options on right
  set the current shape to be the first of the three options
  DrawGrid() // Draw the game grid (currently empty)
  updateLeve() // Basically draw Score:0 Level: 0
